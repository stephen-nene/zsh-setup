## Install Zsh Plugins

Run the setup script directly:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephen-nene/zsh-setup/master/setup_zsh_plugins.sh | zsh
````

> ⚠️ Review scripts before piping them to a shell.

## 🔐 Safer alternative (no pipe-to-shell)

For users who prefer safety:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephen-nene/zsh-setup/master/setup_zsh_plugins.sh -o setup_zsh_plugins.sh
chmod +x setup_zsh_plugins.sh
./setup_zsh_plugins.sh
````
